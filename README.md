Uncapped:

This is a beer rating app similar to the app Untappd, written using Elixir and the Phoenix framework. User authentication allows users to sign up and log in to rate the beers they are drinking.

-Beers can be added through the Brewery pages, linking them to that brewery.
-Checkins can be done through each of the brewery pages or the main list of all beers registered to the app.
